You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/1965  
Policy Name: EnergizeNC  
Type: Program  
Description:  
The North Carolina EnergizeNC coalition, led by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s State Energy Office, in collaboration with North Carolina Advanced Energy, the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, and the North Carolina Clean Energy Fund, was awarded $156,120,000 in Solar for All funds to develop and execute a robust and equitable program enabling the rapid deployment of distributed solar and associated battery storage. The installations are for low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state, including state- and federally recognized tribal lands.EQUITY DETAILThe coalition will focus on four goals. Goal #1: Create a comprehensive project management approach over a one-year planning period to include input from low-income and disadvantaged communities. Goal #2: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower household energy costs, and foster environmental justice through the installation of rooftop solar at low-income single-family and multifamily units across North Carolina, including community solar access. Goal #3: Foster and develop a trained workforce to deploy solar in all regions of the state, especially in minority and tribal communities, while working to ensure transparent ethical and business practices that protect consumers from potential market abuses. Goal #4: Provide robust community engagement to ensure that project benefits flow to disadvantaged communities and individuals.JUST TRANSITION DETAILGoal #3 is focused on a just transition, which is to foster and develop a trained workforce to deploy solar in all regions of the state.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1999
Name: California Clean Energy Planning Program
Similarity: 0.6345
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: This solicitation has two purposes: 1) make $1,050,000 available to California Native American tribes for clean energy future planning as well as to better enable their participation in statewide clean energy and energy infrastructure planning activities and 2) make $500,000 available to local government entities to develop new or updated land use planning documents that support and advance the development of clean energy in their jurisdiction.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses facilitative terms like “available” and “develop” without mandatory directives (e.g., “shall” or “must”). Participation is framed as optional, not compulsory.
Source of Authority: Likely established through administrative funding (state budget or agency allocation), not statutory law. It functions as a grant program, not a regulatory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties or compliance requirements for tribes or local governments. Enforcement applies only to grant administration (e.g., ensuring funds are used as stipulated).
Obligations: Participation is voluntary—tribes and local governments are not legally required to apply for funding or undertake planning activities.
Optionality/Incentives: Grants act as financial incentives to encourage clean energy planning, but adoption remains discretionary.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/247
Name: The Solar Photovoltaic Systems Recovery, Reuse, and Recycling Working Group
Similarity: 0.6277
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Photovoltaic Systems (PV) Working Group will focus on options for recycling or reusing solar panels.
The Working Group shall:
Review solar photovoltaic systems currently used in the state, including:Examining the expected economically productive life cycle of the systems; Reviewing the materials that are used, have been used, or may be used in PV systems sold in the state,including identifying materials that can be recycled or that exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law; andIdentifying the number of solar photovoltaic systems in use and estimating the potential impacts of the state's landfill capacity of disposing the systems in the state's landfills.
Review other programs on PV systems recycling, disposal, and decommissioning.
Identify ongoing and recent studies related to solar photovoltaic systems recycling, life-cycle analysis, and end-of-life programs.
Review industry-approved best practices for managing end-of-life solar photovoltaic systems and their components, including the extent to which the systems and components may be:if not substantially damaged, refurbished and reused for a similar purpose; recycled and the components recovered for reuse; for components that do not exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law, safely disposed of in a construction and demolition or municipal solid waste landfill; andfor components that exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law, safely disposed of in accordance with state and federal requirements;
Perform an economic analysis to determine the potential impact of solar photovoltaic systems recovery, reuse, and recycling n ratepayers, including a comparison to the economic impact on ratepayers of decommissioning, storing waste, and other costs associated with the end of life of other forms of energy generation;
Perform an impact assessment to examine the environmental impacts of various PV systems' end-of-life scenarios, including the scenarios specified under item 4 of this subsection, compared to the life-cycle environmental impacts of non-solar energy generation sources in the state, including the environmental impacts of decommissioning, disposal, and long-term waste storage;
Perform an impact assessment to examine the environmental and economic benefits of generating energy from PV systems, including a comparison to the environmental and economic benefits of non-solar energy generation sources in the state;
Recommend financing mechanisms analyzed under item 9 of this subsection that best support a circular economy approach.
Analyze whether financing mechanisms, including advance recovery fees, recycling and disposal fees, and product stewardship programs are necessary to ensure proper end-of-life management of solar photovoltaic systems; and
Examine and recommend infrastructure needed to develop a practical, effective, and cost-efficient method for collecting and transporting end-of-life solar photovoltaic modules for reuse, refurbishment, recycling, or disposal.
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article the Working Group shall report its findings and recommendation to the Commission and the General Assembly on or before December 31, 2023.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “The Working Group shall review,” “shall report”) for all tasks, including conducting studies, analyses, and submitting findings by the statutory deadline (December 31, 2023).
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, granting it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory reporting deadline and oversight by the Commission and General Assembly imply accountability. Non-compliance (e.g., failure to submit the report) would violate the law.
Obligations: The Working Group is legally required to:
Conduct all listed reviews, analyses, and assessments (e.g., economic analysis, environmental impact assessments).
Submit findings and recommendations to the legislature by the 2023 deadline.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the Working Group’s formation, tasks, and reporting are compulsory.

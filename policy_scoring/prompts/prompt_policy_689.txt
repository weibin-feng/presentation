You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/689  
Policy Name: Expert Advisory Committee on Climate Change  
Type: Governance  
Description:  
For the purpose of effectively implementing the Government’s general policy on climate change established herein, and to strategically set Puerto Rico on the right path, the Expert Advisory Committee on Climate Change attached to the Department of Natural Resources is hereby created as an entity with full autonomy and independence to address substantive matters, entrusted with the duty to advise and devise the Climate Change Mitigation, Adaptation, and Resilience Plan to be evaluated by the Joint Committee on Climate Change Mitigation, Adaptation, and Resilience.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/476
Name: North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council
Similarity: 0.6272
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: On October 29, 2018, Governor Cooper established the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council as part of Executive Order No. 80 North Carolina's Commitment To Address Climate Change And Transition To A Clean Energy Economy:
The Secretary or designee of each cabinet agency and a representative from the Governor's Office shall serve on the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council ("Council"), which is hereby established. The Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, or the Secretary's designee, shall serve as the Council Chair. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality shall lead the Council by providing strategic direction, scheduling and planning Council meetings, determining the prioritization of activities, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and assisting in the implementation of pathways to achieve the goals provided in Section 1 of this Executive Order.
The duties of the Council shall include the following: a. Recommend new and updated goals and actions to meaningfully address climate change; b. Develop, implement, and evaluate programs and activities that support statewide climate mitigation and adaptation practices; c. Establish workgroups, as appropriate, to assist the Council in its duties; d. Consider stakeholder input when developing recommendations, programs, and other actions and activities; e. Schedule, monitor, and provide input on the preparation and development of the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order; f. Review and submit to the Governor the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses unequivocally mandatory terms like “shall” (e.g., “Secretary or designee shall serve,” “duties shall include”), legally obligating state cabinet agencies to participate in the Council and fulfill specific tasks (e.g., developing plans, submitting reports). This language is binding, even though it originates from an executive order rather than legislation.
Source of Authority: Established via Executive Order No. 80, which carries legal authority within the state’s administrative framework. In the U.S. system, executive orders are enforceable directives for state agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction and constitute administrative law. While less permanent than statutory law, they are legally binding for state agencies.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties (e.g., fines) are not mentioned, compliance is ensured through executive oversight (e.g., requiring agencies to report progress, accountability to the Governor). Administrative consequences (e.g., budget adjustments, reputational pressure) serve as enforcement tools. Enforcement relies on hierarchical governance (internal accountability) rather than judicial penalties, but this is still a valid mechanism for binding obligations.
Obligations: Cabinet agencies must participate in the Council and complete mandated tasks (e.g., developing climate programs, submitting assessments). Participation and compliance are compulsory, not optional. The Council’s duties (e.g., “develop, implement, and evaluate programs”) are actionable mandates, not mere suggestions.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation or incentives. Compliance is required as a legal duty under the executive order, not incentivized through rewards.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/246
Name: Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group
Similarity: 0.5737
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group is primarily composed of representatives of electric energy companies and will focus on energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency and battery backups.
THE WORKING GROUP SHALL: Advise the commission on issues and opportunities related to energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency improvement, and battery backup viability; and
Conduct a study of:
Methods for the state to encourage electricity storage technology research;
Methods of increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical facilities during widespread power outage;
Potential electric grid distribution transformation projects;
The potential to develop clean energy resources on previously developed project sites; and
The lifespan and viability of energy facilities in the state that do not emit Greenhouse Gas, including:1. Solar energy generating facilities
Nuclear energy generating facilities
Wind energy generating facilities
Geothermal energy generating facilities
Hydroelectric energy generating facilities
Biofuel energy generating facilities
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article, the Working Group shall report to the Commission and the General Assembly, on the findings of the study on or before December 31, 2023

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “THE WORKING GROUP SHALL advise,” “shall report”) for the working group’s actions, including conducting the study and submitting findings by a statutory deadline. While the study topics include terms like “encourage” and “supporting,” these describe the content of the study, not the working group’s obligations under the law.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, giving it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: The working group is legally required to complete and submit the report by December 31, 2023. Failure to meet this obligation would violate statutory requirements, triggering accountability (e.g., legislative oversight, potential legal action).
Obligations: The working group must conduct the study, advise the commission, and submit findings. The mandate focuses on process (completing tasks), not the outcome of recommendations (which may later require separate adoption).
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the working group’s formation, study, and reporting are compulsory.

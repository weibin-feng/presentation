You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/67  
Policy Name: Cement GHG Intensity Goal  
Type: Targets/Goal  
Description:  
The state board shall establish interim targets for reductions in the greenhouse gas intensity of cement used within the state relative to the average greenhouse gas intensity of cement used within the state during the 2019 calendar year, with the goal of reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of cement used within the state to 40 percent below the 2019 average levels by December 31, 2035

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/631
Name: 2040 Zero-Carbon Target
Similarity: 0.7958
Score: 3
Type: Targets/Goal
Description: Public Act 22-5 (Senate Bill 10), An Act Concerning Climate Change Mitigation: This bill, which was sponsored by Governor Lamont, codifies into law the 2040 zero-carbon electric grid goal that Governor Lamont established through an executive order that he issued in 2019 (Executive Order No. 3).
The state shall reduce the level of emissions of greenhouse gas: (1) Not later than January 1, 2020, to a level at least ten per cent below the level emitted in 1990; (2) Not later than January 1, 2030, to a level at least forty-five percent below the level emitted in 2001; [and] (3) Not later than January 1, 2040, to a level of zero per cent from electricity supplied to electric customers in the state; (4) Not later than January 1, 2050, to a level at least eighty percent below the level emitted in 2001; [.] and (5) All of the levels referenced in this subsection shall be determined by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the state shall reduce”) and specifies binding deadlines (e.g., 2040 for zero-carbon electricity) with quantified emissions targets.
Source of Authority: Codified into law via Public Act 22-5 (statute), granting it legal enforceability. This elevates it from the original executive order to a statutory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties are not detailed, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection is legally tasked with determining compliance levels, implying regulatory oversight and potential enforcement tools (e.g., future regulations or reporting requirements).
Obligations: The state is legally obligated to meet the emissions reduction targets, though the law does not specify obligations for individual entities (e.g., utilities, industries). Compliance likely depends on subsequent regulations or sector-specific policies.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs, exemptions, or incentives. The targets are compulsory for the state as a whole, with no flexibility in deadlines or thresholds.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1482
Name: 2015, 2025, 2030, 2050 Statewide GHG Targets
Similarity: 0.7101
Score: 2
Type: Targets/Goal
Description: Sec. 61. Minnesota Statutes 2022, section 216H.02, subdivision 1, is amended to read: Subdivision 1.Greenhouse gas emissions-reduction goal.(a) It is the goal of the state to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors producing those greenhouse gas emissions by at least the following amounts, compared with the level of emissions in 2005:(1) 15 percent by 2015;(2) 30 percent by 2025;(3) 50 percent by 2030; and(4) to net zero by 2050.To the maximum extent practicable, actions taken to achieve these goals must avoid causing disproportionate adverse impacts to residents of communities that are or have been incommensurately exposed to pollution affecting human health and environmental quality.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy frames GHG reduction targets as a non-binding "goal of the state" rather than using mandatory terms like "shall" or "must." While the clause "actions taken to achieve these goals must avoid disproportionate adverse impacts" imposes a binding equity requirement, this applies only to implementation methods, not the GHG targets themselves.
Source of Authority: Codified in state law (Minnesota Statutes §216H.02), but the statute lacks actionable mandates or delegated authority for enforcement. The "goal" language weakens legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: No compliance mechanisms (e.g., penalties, sector-specific regulations) or accountability tools (e.g., reporting deadlines) are specified. The law does not empower agencies to enforce the targets.
Obligations: The state is not legally required to take specific actions (e.g., passing regulations, funding programs) to meet the targets. No responsibilities are assigned to agencies, industries, or individuals.
Optionality/Incentives: No financial incentives (e.g., grants, tax credits) or penalties for non-compliance. Achievement of targets relies on future discretionary policies.

You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/96  
Policy Name: The Office of Just Transition (OJT)  
Type: Governance  
Description:  
The Just Transition Office and Advisory Committee has several functions, including 1) identifying when and where coal plants are slated to close, and how many workers and communities may be negatively impacted by these closures, 2) developing a just transition plan that identifies sources of funding that can effectively respond to these economic disruptions

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1332
Name: Council on the Green Economy
Similarity: 0.5938
Score: 2
Type: Governance
Description: The members of the Council on the Green Economy serve to develop a blueprint for expanding the green economy and building a diverse workforce to support the Administration’s clean energy and climate goals. Members of the Council include representatives from State departments, as well as leaders from chambers of commerce, organized labor, industry, utilities, green business, environmental justice communities, academia, small business, workforce development, and environmental advocacy.
Just Transition Detail: The Council will lay out the pathways for transitioning fossil fuel and other displaced jobs to clean energy jobs, as well as laying the groundwork to ensure that the opportunities presented by the clean energy economy are open to a new generation of New Jersey workers, including people who are traditionally underrepresented in the energy sector. The Council is housed under the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. The Director of the Climate Action Office will be the Executive Director of the Council, overseeing it’s work and supervising its consultants. Working with the economic development team within the GO and relevant agencies and authorities across state government, the Director will ensure comprehensive policy and communicate the critical message that the transition to clean energy drives economic growth and job creation. Green Jobs Council objectives include but are not limited to: Coordination of relevant governmental programs; Incorporation of equitable workforce development strategies into all environmental and clean energy initiatives, including a framework to support high quality employment and collective bargaining; Significant targeted investment in workforce development, education, apprenticeship/internship, training and certification, and retraining programs; Formation of career services, green job pathways, and outreach to underrepresented and underserved groups, including women, and displaced fossil fuel workers; Dedicated supports for displaced workers including employment counseling, reskilling, transitional income, and relocation support.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses directive terms like “will lay out,” “coordination,” and “ensure,” but lacks unequivocally mandatory language (e.g., “shall” or “must”). While the Council is tasked with developing strategies and pathways, these are framed as objectives rather than enforceable requirements.
Source of Authority: Likely established via executive action under the Governor’s Office of Climate Action, not statutory law. Its authority stems from administrative structuring rather than codified legal mandates.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties, compliance deadlines, or oversight tools are specified. The Council’s role is strategic and advisory, focusing on planning and coordination without binding enforcement mechanisms for external actors (e.g., businesses, displaced workers).
Obligations: The Council itself is obligated to develop strategies and coordinate programs (e.g., workforce development, equitable investments), but these tasks are internal to the Council’s advisory function. External entities are not legally required to adopt the Council’s recommendations or participate in its initiatives.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation in the Council’s programs (e.g., workforce training, career services) is voluntary. The Council promotes incentives like “targeted investment” and “dedicated supports,” but these are framed as opportunities, not conditional requirements.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/476
Name: North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council
Similarity: 0.5589
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: On October 29, 2018, Governor Cooper established the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council as part of Executive Order No. 80 North Carolina's Commitment To Address Climate Change And Transition To A Clean Energy Economy:
The Secretary or designee of each cabinet agency and a representative from the Governor's Office shall serve on the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council ("Council"), which is hereby established. The Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, or the Secretary's designee, shall serve as the Council Chair. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality shall lead the Council by providing strategic direction, scheduling and planning Council meetings, determining the prioritization of activities, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and assisting in the implementation of pathways to achieve the goals provided in Section 1 of this Executive Order.
The duties of the Council shall include the following: a. Recommend new and updated goals and actions to meaningfully address climate change; b. Develop, implement, and evaluate programs and activities that support statewide climate mitigation and adaptation practices; c. Establish workgroups, as appropriate, to assist the Council in its duties; d. Consider stakeholder input when developing recommendations, programs, and other actions and activities; e. Schedule, monitor, and provide input on the preparation and development of the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order; f. Review and submit to the Governor the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses unequivocally mandatory terms like “shall” (e.g., “Secretary or designee shall serve,” “duties shall include”), legally obligating state cabinet agencies to participate in the Council and fulfill specific tasks (e.g., developing plans, submitting reports). This language is binding, even though it originates from an executive order rather than legislation.
Source of Authority: Established via Executive Order No. 80, which carries legal authority within the state’s administrative framework. In the U.S. system, executive orders are enforceable directives for state agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction and constitute administrative law. While less permanent than statutory law, they are legally binding for state agencies.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties (e.g., fines) are not mentioned, compliance is ensured through executive oversight (e.g., requiring agencies to report progress, accountability to the Governor). Administrative consequences (e.g., budget adjustments, reputational pressure) serve as enforcement tools. Enforcement relies on hierarchical governance (internal accountability) rather than judicial penalties, but this is still a valid mechanism for binding obligations.
Obligations: Cabinet agencies must participate in the Council and complete mandated tasks (e.g., developing climate programs, submitting assessments). Participation and compliance are compulsory, not optional. The Council’s duties (e.g., “develop, implement, and evaluate programs”) are actionable mandates, not mere suggestions.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation or incentives. Compliance is required as a legal duty under the executive order, not incentivized through rewards.

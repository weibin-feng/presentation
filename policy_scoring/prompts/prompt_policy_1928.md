You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/1928  
Policy Name: Uniform Floodplain Management Policy for State Property  
Type: Standard  
Description:  
In compliance with Governor Roy Cooper's Executive Order 266, the North Carolina Department of Administration (NCDOA) has released a new policy that updates design and construction requirements for new state government and university buildings in flood-prone areas for the first time in over thirty years. The guidance will increase climate resiliency for public buildings and structures, save taxpayer money, protect public investments and promote innovative nature-based design solutions.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/476
Name: North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council
Similarity: 0.6047
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: On October 29, 2018, Governor Cooper established the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council as part of Executive Order No. 80 North Carolina's Commitment To Address Climate Change And Transition To A Clean Energy Economy:
The Secretary or designee of each cabinet agency and a representative from the Governor's Office shall serve on the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council ("Council"), which is hereby established. The Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, or the Secretary's designee, shall serve as the Council Chair. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality shall lead the Council by providing strategic direction, scheduling and planning Council meetings, determining the prioritization of activities, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and assisting in the implementation of pathways to achieve the goals provided in Section 1 of this Executive Order.
The duties of the Council shall include the following: a. Recommend new and updated goals and actions to meaningfully address climate change; b. Develop, implement, and evaluate programs and activities that support statewide climate mitigation and adaptation practices; c. Establish workgroups, as appropriate, to assist the Council in its duties; d. Consider stakeholder input when developing recommendations, programs, and other actions and activities; e. Schedule, monitor, and provide input on the preparation and development of the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order; f. Review and submit to the Governor the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses unequivocally mandatory terms like “shall” (e.g., “Secretary or designee shall serve,” “duties shall include”), legally obligating state cabinet agencies to participate in the Council and fulfill specific tasks (e.g., developing plans, submitting reports). This language is binding, even though it originates from an executive order rather than legislation.
Source of Authority: Established via Executive Order No. 80, which carries legal authority within the state’s administrative framework. In the U.S. system, executive orders are enforceable directives for state agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction and constitute administrative law. While less permanent than statutory law, they are legally binding for state agencies.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties (e.g., fines) are not mentioned, compliance is ensured through executive oversight (e.g., requiring agencies to report progress, accountability to the Governor). Administrative consequences (e.g., budget adjustments, reputational pressure) serve as enforcement tools. Enforcement relies on hierarchical governance (internal accountability) rather than judicial penalties, but this is still a valid mechanism for binding obligations.
Obligations: Cabinet agencies must participate in the Council and complete mandated tasks (e.g., developing climate programs, submitting assessments). Participation and compliance are compulsory, not optional. The Council’s duties (e.g., “develop, implement, and evaluate programs”) are actionable mandates, not mere suggestions.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation or incentives. Compliance is required as a legal duty under the executive order, not incentivized through rewards.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1016
Name: Energy Code Board
Similarity: 0.4911
Score: 3
Type: Standard
Description: The Colorado General Assembly passed the Building Energy Codes law (HB22-1362 Building Greenhouse Gas Emissions) in May of 2022 to improve energy use and efficiency in buildings. An updated energy code is an important tool to increase building efficiency and meet the state’s economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 50% by 2030, from a 2005 baseline.
The legislation directs the Energy Code Board to perform the following work: Model Electric Ready and Solar Ready Code - the Energy Code Board will develop and adopt a model electric ready code and solar ready code with the intent to prepare new homes and buildings for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and high efficiency electric appliances. These codes must be adopted by the Board on or before June 1, 2023. Cities and counties with building codes must adopt at least the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) when they update other building codes between July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2026. This adoption must include the electric and solar ready provisions in the model electric ready and solar ready code. Model Low Energy and Carbon Code - the Energy Code Board will develop and adopt a model low energy and carbon code with the intent of minimizing overall carbon dioxide emissions associated with new and renovated homes and commercial buildings, based on either the 2021 IECC or the 2024 IECC, plus any appendices and the model electric ready and solar ready code. This code must be adopted by the Board on or before June 1, 2025. Cities and counties with building codes must adopt the model low energy and carbon code when they update other building codes after July 1, 2026.
In addition to the work of the Energy Code Board, the Colorado Energy Office is directed by this legislation to perform the following work: Model Green Code - CEO will promote a model green code that local governments may voluntarily adopt, in addition to the required energy code. The model green code addresses building attributes such as materials, water use, and indoor air quality. Code Training Assistance and Building Upgrades - the Legislature appropriated $4 million for CEO to provide code training and assistance, along with $21 million to support decarbonization of public buildings and communities with a focus on incentives for lower income households and historically disadvantaged communities.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “must adopt” (e.g., “cities and counties must adopt at least the 2021 IECC”), “directs,” and “will develop and adopt,” with strict deadlines (e.g., “on or before June 1, 2023”). The voluntary “may adopt” applies only to the non-binding model green code.
Source of Authority: Codified in state law (HB22-1362), giving it statutory authority. The Energy Code Board and Colorado Energy Office are legally mandated to act.
Enforcement Mechanism: Compliance is enforced through building code updates: cities/counties updating codes must adopt the state’s model energy codes. While penalties are not explicitly stated, non-compliance would likely affect permitting or legal approval for construction projects.
Obligations: The Energy Code Board must develop and adopt model codes by statutory deadlines. Cities/counties with building codes must adopt the 2021 IECC (with electric/solar-ready provisions) by 2026 and the low-energy/carbon code after 2026. The Colorado Energy Office must promote the voluntary green code and administer funding.
Optionality/Incentives: The model green code is voluntary (“may adopt”). $25 million in funding incentivizes training and building upgrades, but code adoption itself is compulsory for local governments.

You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/459  
Policy Name: New York State Climate Action Council  
Type: Governance  
Description:  
The New York State Climate Action Council is a 22-member appointed body that has prepared a Scoping Plan to serve as the roadmap to achieve the State’s bold clean energy and climate goals.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/476
Name: North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council
Similarity: 0.7209
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: On October 29, 2018, Governor Cooper established the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council as part of Executive Order No. 80 North Carolina's Commitment To Address Climate Change And Transition To A Clean Energy Economy:
The Secretary or designee of each cabinet agency and a representative from the Governor's Office shall serve on the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council ("Council"), which is hereby established. The Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, or the Secretary's designee, shall serve as the Council Chair. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality shall lead the Council by providing strategic direction, scheduling and planning Council meetings, determining the prioritization of activities, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and assisting in the implementation of pathways to achieve the goals provided in Section 1 of this Executive Order.
The duties of the Council shall include the following: a. Recommend new and updated goals and actions to meaningfully address climate change; b. Develop, implement, and evaluate programs and activities that support statewide climate mitigation and adaptation practices; c. Establish workgroups, as appropriate, to assist the Council in its duties; d. Consider stakeholder input when developing recommendations, programs, and other actions and activities; e. Schedule, monitor, and provide input on the preparation and development of the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order; f. Review and submit to the Governor the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses unequivocally mandatory terms like “shall” (e.g., “Secretary or designee shall serve,” “duties shall include”), legally obligating state cabinet agencies to participate in the Council and fulfill specific tasks (e.g., developing plans, submitting reports). This language is binding, even though it originates from an executive order rather than legislation.
Source of Authority: Established via Executive Order No. 80, which carries legal authority within the state’s administrative framework. In the U.S. system, executive orders are enforceable directives for state agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction and constitute administrative law. While less permanent than statutory law, they are legally binding for state agencies.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties (e.g., fines) are not mentioned, compliance is ensured through executive oversight (e.g., requiring agencies to report progress, accountability to the Governor). Administrative consequences (e.g., budget adjustments, reputational pressure) serve as enforcement tools. Enforcement relies on hierarchical governance (internal accountability) rather than judicial penalties, but this is still a valid mechanism for binding obligations.
Obligations: Cabinet agencies must participate in the Council and complete mandated tasks (e.g., developing climate programs, submitting assessments). Participation and compliance are compulsory, not optional. The Council’s duties (e.g., “develop, implement, and evaluate programs”) are actionable mandates, not mere suggestions.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation or incentives. Compliance is required as a legal duty under the executive order, not incentivized through rewards.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1369
Name: Colorado Climate Corps
Similarity: 0.5836
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: Colorado Climate Corps is a multi-pronged strategy to address climate change and advance the Governor’s bold goal of moving Colorado’s electric grid to 100% renewable sources by 2040 and protecting the environment for future generations, by any of the following:
Providing critical capacity and support to local governments, especially county commissions, to develop and execute climate action plans and/or projects;
Building upon and expanding existing conservation and youth corps to do hands-on projects, including wildfire and flood mitigation;
Implementing additional environment and energy projects with nonprofits, higher education, Tribes, and local or state government that accelerate the adoption of clean, renewable resources and energy efficiency, advancing electrification efforts in our transportation sector, mitigate against droughts, floods, and wildfires, and ensuring the conservation of our public lands and wildlife.
Colorado Climate Corps is a collaboration with the Colorado Interagency Climate Team.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses facilitative terms like “providing,” “building upon,” and “implementing” but lacks mandatory directives (e.g., “must,” “shall”). Participation by local governments, nonprofits, or other entities is framed as optional support rather than a legal requirement.
Source of Authority: Likely established via executive initiative or interagency collaboration (Colorado Interagency Climate Team), not statutory law. The Governor’s renewable energy goal is aspirational, not codified as a binding mandate for the Corps itself.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties or compliance deadlines. The program focuses on capacity-building and project implementation through partnerships, with no enforcement tools for non-participation.
Obligations: Target actors (local governments, nonprofits, etc.) are not legally obligated to engage with the Climate Corps. The program offers assistance but does not impose requirements.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation is voluntary and incentivized through support for climate projects (e.g., funding, technical assistance).

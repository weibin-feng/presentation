You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/2004  
Policy Name: New Mexico Federal Funding Dashboard  
Type: Analysis and Tools  
Description:  
The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) are powering change in communities around New Mexico. With project data dating back to 2021, this interactive dashboard includes information about the breadth, scope and geographic diversity of nearly 2,400 projects made possible by more than $6.5 billion through ARPA and BIL.ARPA and BIL have funded projects in all 33 New Mexico counties, including brick and mortar projects like child care centers, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, and community spaces, as well as rental payment and unemployment assistance to New Mexicans affected by the pandemic.Our Federal Funding Dashboard is a go-to source for transparent information on how the federal dollars flowing into New Mexico are being put to use. Explore the data and see how these investments are making a difference in your community. (Note: Beyond the recent federal laws covered on this dashboard, State agencies rely upon hundreds of federal grants, not reflected here, that support core programs and projects.)

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/200
Name: Illinois Finance Authority Climate Bank
Similarity: 0.4686
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: The bill designates the Illinois Finance Authority, established in the Illinois Finance Authority Act, as a "Climate Bank" to leverage public-private partnerships to fund clean energy projects across the state. In its role as the Climate Bank of the State, the Authority shall have the power to: (i) administer programs and funds appropriated by the General Assembly for clean energy projects in eligible communities and environmental justice communities or owned by eligible persons, (ii) support investment in the clean energy and clean water, drinking water, and wastewater treatment, (iii) support and otherwise promote investment in clean energy projects to foster the growth, development, and commercialization of clean energy projects and related enterprises, and (iv) stimulate demand for clean energy and the development of clean energy projects

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses a mix of mandatory and non-binding terms. While the Illinois Finance Authority “shall have the power” to administer programs and support clean energy projects, the language focuses on enabling functions (e.g., “support,” “promote”) rather than imposing obligations on external actors.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (bill under the Illinois Finance Authority Act), granting the Climate Bank legal authority to operate. However, the program itself functions as a funding and partnership mechanism, not a regulatory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties or compliance requirements are specified. The Climate Bank’s role is to facilitate funding and partnerships, with participation by private entities or communities being voluntary.
Obligations: The Authority is legally obligated to administer programs and funds, but external actors (e.g., businesses, communities) are not required to participate. Compliance is optional for project applicants or partners.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation in Climate Bank programs is voluntary and incentivized through funding opportunities.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1580
Name: Green and Healthy Task Force
Similarity: 0.4678
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: BEGINNING JULY 1, 2023, MEET QUARTERLY FOR A PERIOD OF 3 YEARS; ADVANCE THE ALIGNMENT, BRANDING, AND COORDINATION OF RESOURCES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER GREEN AND HEALTHY HOUSING FOR LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE; EXAMINE THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF LOW–INCOME COMMUNITIES; DEVELOP POLICY AND STATUTORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING HEALTHY, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND AFFORDABLE, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING; AND ENGAGE WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT CAN HELP ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE TASK FORCE, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHY AND, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING. ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2024, AND EACH JULY 1 THROUGH 2027, THE TASK FORCE SHALL REPORT ITS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, THE SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMMISSION, THE GOVERNOR, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 2–1257 OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT ARTICLE, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the Task Force shall report its findings”) and specifies deadlines (e.g., “on or before July 1, 2024”). These terms impose clear obligations.
Source of Authority: The task force is tied to statutory law (§ 2–1257 of the State Government Article), indicating it was established through legislative authority, which carries legal weight.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory foundation implies accountability mechanisms (e.g., governmental oversight) for meeting reporting deadlines and operational requirements (e.g., quarterly meetings).
Obligations: The task force is legally obligated to meet quarterly, develop recommendations, and submit annual reports to state officials and the legislature. Participation in the task force itself is likely mandatory for appointed members.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs or incentives are mentioned. The policy creates binding procedural requirements for the task force, even though its recommendations may later require separate adoption to become enforceable.

You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/2046  
Policy Name: Michigan Renewables Ready Communities Grant  
Type: Program  
Description:  
The Environmental Protection Agency has awarded the State of Michigan $129.1 million from the Biden-Harris administration’s Inflation Reduction Act’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy like wind, solar, and storage. The funding will allow the state to launch Renewables Ready Communities. Administered by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, the program will incentivize the permitting of renewable energy projects through local processes.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1893
Name: Make it in Michigan Competitiveness Fund Climate Justice Challenge
Similarity: 0.7560
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: In November 2023, the EPA released the Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants program, allocating $2 billion to benefit disadvantaged communities through projects to reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience, and build community response capacity. The program design integrated nationwide community and stakeholder input, and the resulting grants will focus on community-driven and place-based initiatives to advance environmental justice and climate equity.
The State of Michigan announced in May 2024 that through the Make it in Michigan Competitiveness Fund it will provide five percent (5%) match funding of the total awarded amount for eligible Community Change Grant applications awarded by the EPA to fund projects benefiting disadvantaged community(ies) in Michigan, provided that the application for the Community Change Grant is fully submitted to the EPA prior to August 1, 2024.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses conditional terms like “provided that” for eligibility but lacks mandatory language (e.g., “shall” or “required”). Participation hinges on voluntary action (submitting an application by the deadline).
Source of Authority: The program stems from state funding (Michigan Competitiveness Fund) and complements the EPA’s federal grant program. It operates as a financial incentive mechanism, not a standalone law or regulation.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties are specified. The August 1, 2024, deadline acts as an eligibility criterion for receiving the match funding, but non-participation does not incur consequences.
Obligations: Applicants for EPA grants are not legally obligated to seek or accept Michigan’s 5% match. Participation is optional, targeting those who want supplemental state funding.
Optionality/Incentives: The 5% match is purely incentivized—projects can proceed with EPA grants alone. The policy encourages timely applications but does not mandate action.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/200
Name: Illinois Finance Authority Climate Bank
Similarity: 0.6710
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: The bill designates the Illinois Finance Authority, established in the Illinois Finance Authority Act, as a "Climate Bank" to leverage public-private partnerships to fund clean energy projects across the state. In its role as the Climate Bank of the State, the Authority shall have the power to: (i) administer programs and funds appropriated by the General Assembly for clean energy projects in eligible communities and environmental justice communities or owned by eligible persons, (ii) support investment in the clean energy and clean water, drinking water, and wastewater treatment, (iii) support and otherwise promote investment in clean energy projects to foster the growth, development, and commercialization of clean energy projects and related enterprises, and (iv) stimulate demand for clean energy and the development of clean energy projects

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses a mix of mandatory and non-binding terms. While the Illinois Finance Authority “shall have the power” to administer programs and support clean energy projects, the language focuses on enabling functions (e.g., “support,” “promote”) rather than imposing obligations on external actors.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (bill under the Illinois Finance Authority Act), granting the Climate Bank legal authority to operate. However, the program itself functions as a funding and partnership mechanism, not a regulatory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties or compliance requirements are specified. The Climate Bank’s role is to facilitate funding and partnerships, with participation by private entities or communities being voluntary.
Obligations: The Authority is legally obligated to administer programs and funds, but external actors (e.g., businesses, communities) are not required to participate. Compliance is optional for project applicants or partners.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation in Climate Bank programs is voluntary and incentivized through funding opportunities.

You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/260  
Policy Name: Climate Impacted Communities Assessment  
Type: Analysis and Tools  
Description:  
By December 31, 2023, the Maryland Department of the Environment, in coordination with the Commission on Environmental Justice and Sustainable Communities, must must (1) adopt a methodology for identifying communities disproportionately affected by climate impacts, as specified; (2) develop specific strategies to address geographical impact concerns, reduce emissions of GHGs and co-pollutants, and build climate equity and resilience within disproportionately affected communities; (3) set appropriate goals for the percentage of State funding for GHG emissions reduction measures that should be used for the benefit of disproportionately affected communities; and (4) report the policies and programs developed pursuant to the bill to the Maryland Commission on Climate Change (MCCC).

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1369
Name: Colorado Climate Corps
Similarity: 0.6350
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: Colorado Climate Corps is a multi-pronged strategy to address climate change and advance the Governor’s bold goal of moving Colorado’s electric grid to 100% renewable sources by 2040 and protecting the environment for future generations, by any of the following:
Providing critical capacity and support to local governments, especially county commissions, to develop and execute climate action plans and/or projects;
Building upon and expanding existing conservation and youth corps to do hands-on projects, including wildfire and flood mitigation;
Implementing additional environment and energy projects with nonprofits, higher education, Tribes, and local or state government that accelerate the adoption of clean, renewable resources and energy efficiency, advancing electrification efforts in our transportation sector, mitigate against droughts, floods, and wildfires, and ensuring the conservation of our public lands and wildlife.
Colorado Climate Corps is a collaboration with the Colorado Interagency Climate Team.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses facilitative terms like “providing,” “building upon,” and “implementing” but lacks mandatory directives (e.g., “must,” “shall”). Participation by local governments, nonprofits, or other entities is framed as optional support rather than a legal requirement.
Source of Authority: Likely established via executive initiative or interagency collaboration (Colorado Interagency Climate Team), not statutory law. The Governor’s renewable energy goal is aspirational, not codified as a binding mandate for the Corps itself.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties or compliance deadlines. The program focuses on capacity-building and project implementation through partnerships, with no enforcement tools for non-participation.
Obligations: Target actors (local governments, nonprofits, etc.) are not legally obligated to engage with the Climate Corps. The program offers assistance but does not impose requirements.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation is voluntary and incentivized through support for climate projects (e.g., funding, technical assistance).


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/631
Name: 2040 Zero-Carbon Target
Similarity: 0.6333
Score: 3
Type: Targets/Goal
Description: Public Act 22-5 (Senate Bill 10), An Act Concerning Climate Change Mitigation: This bill, which was sponsored by Governor Lamont, codifies into law the 2040 zero-carbon electric grid goal that Governor Lamont established through an executive order that he issued in 2019 (Executive Order No. 3).
The state shall reduce the level of emissions of greenhouse gas: (1) Not later than January 1, 2020, to a level at least ten per cent below the level emitted in 1990; (2) Not later than January 1, 2030, to a level at least forty-five percent below the level emitted in 2001; [and] (3) Not later than January 1, 2040, to a level of zero per cent from electricity supplied to electric customers in the state; (4) Not later than January 1, 2050, to a level at least eighty percent below the level emitted in 2001; [.] and (5) All of the levels referenced in this subsection shall be determined by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the state shall reduce”) and specifies binding deadlines (e.g., 2040 for zero-carbon electricity) with quantified emissions targets.
Source of Authority: Codified into law via Public Act 22-5 (statute), granting it legal enforceability. This elevates it from the original executive order to a statutory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties are not detailed, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection is legally tasked with determining compliance levels, implying regulatory oversight and potential enforcement tools (e.g., future regulations or reporting requirements).
Obligations: The state is legally obligated to meet the emissions reduction targets, though the law does not specify obligations for individual entities (e.g., utilities, industries). Compliance likely depends on subsequent regulations or sector-specific policies.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs, exemptions, or incentives. The targets are compulsory for the state as a whole, with no flexibility in deadlines or thresholds.

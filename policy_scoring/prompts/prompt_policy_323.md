You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/323  
Policy Name: Council on Climate Solutions  
Type: Governance  
Description:  
The Council must act in an advisory capacity to the governor and the Department, and must do the following:Advise the Department in formulating and overseeing the implementation of the MI Healthy Climate Plan, which will serve as the action plan for this state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition toward economywide carbon neutrality. This work must include, but is not limited to:Identifying and recommending opportunities for the development and effective implementation of emissions-reduction strategies.Identifying solutions to resolve impact disparities across Michigan and recommending targeted solutions for communities disproportionately impacted by the changing climate.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/476
Name: North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council
Similarity: 0.7208
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: On October 29, 2018, Governor Cooper established the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council as part of Executive Order No. 80 North Carolina's Commitment To Address Climate Change And Transition To A Clean Energy Economy:
The Secretary or designee of each cabinet agency and a representative from the Governor's Office shall serve on the North Carolina Climate Change Interagency Council ("Council"), which is hereby established. The Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, or the Secretary's designee, shall serve as the Council Chair. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality shall lead the Council by providing strategic direction, scheduling and planning Council meetings, determining the prioritization of activities, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and assisting in the implementation of pathways to achieve the goals provided in Section 1 of this Executive Order.
The duties of the Council shall include the following: a. Recommend new and updated goals and actions to meaningfully address climate change; b. Develop, implement, and evaluate programs and activities that support statewide climate mitigation and adaptation practices; c. Establish workgroups, as appropriate, to assist the Council in its duties; d. Consider stakeholder input when developing recommendations, programs, and other actions and activities; e. Schedule, monitor, and provide input on the preparation and development of the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order; f. Review and submit to the Governor the plans and assessments required by this Executive Order.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses unequivocally mandatory terms like “shall” (e.g., “Secretary or designee shall serve,” “duties shall include”), legally obligating state cabinet agencies to participate in the Council and fulfill specific tasks (e.g., developing plans, submitting reports). This language is binding, even though it originates from an executive order rather than legislation.
Source of Authority: Established via Executive Order No. 80, which carries legal authority within the state’s administrative framework. In the U.S. system, executive orders are enforceable directives for state agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction and constitute administrative law. While less permanent than statutory law, they are legally binding for state agencies.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties (e.g., fines) are not mentioned, compliance is ensured through executive oversight (e.g., requiring agencies to report progress, accountability to the Governor). Administrative consequences (e.g., budget adjustments, reputational pressure) serve as enforcement tools. Enforcement relies on hierarchical governance (internal accountability) rather than judicial penalties, but this is still a valid mechanism for binding obligations.
Obligations: Cabinet agencies must participate in the Council and complete mandated tasks (e.g., developing climate programs, submitting assessments). Participation and compliance are compulsory, not optional. The Council’s duties (e.g., “develop, implement, and evaluate programs”) are actionable mandates, not mere suggestions.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation or incentives. Compliance is required as a legal duty under the executive order, not incentivized through rewards.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1580
Name: Green and Healthy Task Force
Similarity: 0.6610
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: BEGINNING JULY 1, 2023, MEET QUARTERLY FOR A PERIOD OF 3 YEARS; ADVANCE THE ALIGNMENT, BRANDING, AND COORDINATION OF RESOURCES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER GREEN AND HEALTHY HOUSING FOR LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE; EXAMINE THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF LOW–INCOME COMMUNITIES; DEVELOP POLICY AND STATUTORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING HEALTHY, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND AFFORDABLE, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING; AND ENGAGE WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT CAN HELP ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE TASK FORCE, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHY AND, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING. ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2024, AND EACH JULY 1 THROUGH 2027, THE TASK FORCE SHALL REPORT ITS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, THE SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMMISSION, THE GOVERNOR, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 2–1257 OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT ARTICLE, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the Task Force shall report its findings”) and specifies deadlines (e.g., “on or before July 1, 2024”). These terms impose clear obligations.
Source of Authority: The task force is tied to statutory law (§ 2–1257 of the State Government Article), indicating it was established through legislative authority, which carries legal weight.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory foundation implies accountability mechanisms (e.g., governmental oversight) for meeting reporting deadlines and operational requirements (e.g., quarterly meetings).
Obligations: The task force is legally obligated to meet quarterly, develop recommendations, and submit annual reports to state officials and the legislature. Participation in the task force itself is likely mandatory for appointed members.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs or incentives are mentioned. The policy creates binding procedural requirements for the task force, even though its recommendations may later require separate adoption to become enforceable.

You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/448  
Policy Name: Soil Health initiative  
Type: Program  
Description:  
The Soil Health initiative would have the Department of Agriculture and Markets, in cooperation with the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee, and other partners encourage farmers in urban, suburban and rural communities to adapt soil health practices to optimize soil health

---

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1369
Name: Colorado Climate Corps
Similarity: 0.4286
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: Colorado Climate Corps is a multi-pronged strategy to address climate change and advance the Governor’s bold goal of moving Colorado’s electric grid to 100% renewable sources by 2040 and protecting the environment for future generations, by any of the following:
Providing critical capacity and support to local governments, especially county commissions, to develop and execute climate action plans and/or projects;
Building upon and expanding existing conservation and youth corps to do hands-on projects, including wildfire and flood mitigation;
Implementing additional environment and energy projects with nonprofits, higher education, Tribes, and local or state government that accelerate the adoption of clean, renewable resources and energy efficiency, advancing electrification efforts in our transportation sector, mitigate against droughts, floods, and wildfires, and ensuring the conservation of our public lands and wildlife.
Colorado Climate Corps is a collaboration with the Colorado Interagency Climate Team.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses facilitative terms like “providing,” “building upon,” and “implementing” but lacks mandatory directives (e.g., “must,” “shall”). Participation by local governments, nonprofits, or other entities is framed as optional support rather than a legal requirement.
Source of Authority: Likely established via executive initiative or interagency collaboration (Colorado Interagency Climate Team), not statutory law. The Governor’s renewable energy goal is aspirational, not codified as a binding mandate for the Corps itself.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties or compliance deadlines. The program focuses on capacity-building and project implementation through partnerships, with no enforcement tools for non-participation.
Obligations: Target actors (local governments, nonprofits, etc.) are not legally obligated to engage with the Climate Corps. The program offers assistance but does not impose requirements.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation is voluntary and incentivized through support for climate projects (e.g., funding, technical assistance).


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1580
Name: Green and Healthy Task Force
Similarity: 0.4253
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: BEGINNING JULY 1, 2023, MEET QUARTERLY FOR A PERIOD OF 3 YEARS; ADVANCE THE ALIGNMENT, BRANDING, AND COORDINATION OF RESOURCES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER GREEN AND HEALTHY HOUSING FOR LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE; EXAMINE THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF LOW–INCOME COMMUNITIES; DEVELOP POLICY AND STATUTORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING HEALTHY, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND AFFORDABLE, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING; AND ENGAGE WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT CAN HELP ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE TASK FORCE, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHY AND, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING. ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2024, AND EACH JULY 1 THROUGH 2027, THE TASK FORCE SHALL REPORT ITS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, THE SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMMISSION, THE GOVERNOR, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 2–1257 OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT ARTICLE, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the Task Force shall report its findings”) and specifies deadlines (e.g., “on or before July 1, 2024”). These terms impose clear obligations.
Source of Authority: The task force is tied to statutory law (§ 2–1257 of the State Government Article), indicating it was established through legislative authority, which carries legal weight.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory foundation implies accountability mechanisms (e.g., governmental oversight) for meeting reporting deadlines and operational requirements (e.g., quarterly meetings).
Obligations: The task force is legally obligated to meet quarterly, develop recommendations, and submit annual reports to state officials and the legislature. Participation in the task force itself is likely mandatory for appointed members.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs or incentives are mentioned. The policy creates binding procedural requirements for the task force, even though its recommendations may later require separate adoption to become enforceable.

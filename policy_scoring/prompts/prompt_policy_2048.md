You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/2048  
Policy Name: Pennsylvania Turnpike Solar Right-of-Way Project  
Type: Program  
Description:  
The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PA Turnpike) released a Request for Proposals to construct a series of solar generation facilities in its right of way areas. The Solar Right-of-Way Project will not only offset the PA Turnpike’s electrical consumption but also contribute surplus energy to the electrical distribution system. Under the agreement’s proposed terms, the PA Turnpike would purchase the generated power, at a predetermined rate, from the vendor for 20 years and retain the associated Solar Alternative Energy Credits (SAECs) to provide additional revenue. This project also helps reduce the PA Turnpike’s environmental footprint.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/247
Name: The Solar Photovoltaic Systems Recovery, Reuse, and Recycling Working Group
Similarity: 0.6118
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Photovoltaic Systems (PV) Working Group will focus on options for recycling or reusing solar panels.
The Working Group shall:
Review solar photovoltaic systems currently used in the state, including:Examining the expected economically productive life cycle of the systems; Reviewing the materials that are used, have been used, or may be used in PV systems sold in the state,including identifying materials that can be recycled or that exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law; andIdentifying the number of solar photovoltaic systems in use and estimating the potential impacts of the state's landfill capacity of disposing the systems in the state's landfills.
Review other programs on PV systems recycling, disposal, and decommissioning.
Identify ongoing and recent studies related to solar photovoltaic systems recycling, life-cycle analysis, and end-of-life programs.
Review industry-approved best practices for managing end-of-life solar photovoltaic systems and their components, including the extent to which the systems and components may be:if not substantially damaged, refurbished and reused for a similar purpose; recycled and the components recovered for reuse; for components that do not exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law, safely disposed of in a construction and demolition or municipal solid waste landfill; andfor components that exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law, safely disposed of in accordance with state and federal requirements;
Perform an economic analysis to determine the potential impact of solar photovoltaic systems recovery, reuse, and recycling n ratepayers, including a comparison to the economic impact on ratepayers of decommissioning, storing waste, and other costs associated with the end of life of other forms of energy generation;
Perform an impact assessment to examine the environmental impacts of various PV systems' end-of-life scenarios, including the scenarios specified under item 4 of this subsection, compared to the life-cycle environmental impacts of non-solar energy generation sources in the state, including the environmental impacts of decommissioning, disposal, and long-term waste storage;
Perform an impact assessment to examine the environmental and economic benefits of generating energy from PV systems, including a comparison to the environmental and economic benefits of non-solar energy generation sources in the state;
Recommend financing mechanisms analyzed under item 9 of this subsection that best support a circular economy approach.
Analyze whether financing mechanisms, including advance recovery fees, recycling and disposal fees, and product stewardship programs are necessary to ensure proper end-of-life management of solar photovoltaic systems; and
Examine and recommend infrastructure needed to develop a practical, effective, and cost-efficient method for collecting and transporting end-of-life solar photovoltaic modules for reuse, refurbishment, recycling, or disposal.
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article the Working Group shall report its findings and recommendation to the Commission and the General Assembly on or before December 31, 2023.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “The Working Group shall review,” “shall report”) for all tasks, including conducting studies, analyses, and submitting findings by the statutory deadline (December 31, 2023).
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, granting it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory reporting deadline and oversight by the Commission and General Assembly imply accountability. Non-compliance (e.g., failure to submit the report) would violate the law.
Obligations: The Working Group is legally required to:
Conduct all listed reviews, analyses, and assessments (e.g., economic analysis, environmental impact assessments).
Submit findings and recommendations to the legislature by the 2023 deadline.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the Working Group’s formation, tasks, and reporting are compulsory.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/246
Name: Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group
Similarity: 0.5318
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group is primarily composed of representatives of electric energy companies and will focus on energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency and battery backups.
THE WORKING GROUP SHALL: Advise the commission on issues and opportunities related to energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency improvement, and battery backup viability; and
Conduct a study of:
Methods for the state to encourage electricity storage technology research;
Methods of increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical facilities during widespread power outage;

Hydroelectric energy generating facilities
Biofuel energy generating facilities
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article, the Working Group shall report to the Commission and the General Assembly, on the findings of the study on or before December 31, 2023

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “THE WORKING GROUP SHALL advise,” “shall report”) for the working group’s actions, including conducting the study and submitting findings by a statutory deadline. While the study topics include terms like “encourage” and “supporting,” these describe the content of the study, not the working group’s obligations under the law.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, giving it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: The working group is legally required to complete and submit the report by December 31, 2023. Failure to meet this obligation would violate statutory requirements, triggering accountability (e.g., legislative oversight, potential legal action).
Obligations: The working group must conduct the study, advise the commission, and submit findings. The mandate focuses on process (completing tasks), not the outcome of recommendations (which may later require separate adoption).
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the working group’s formation, study, and reporting are compulsory.

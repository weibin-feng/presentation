You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/262  
Policy Name: Energy Industry Revitalization Working Group  
Type: Governance  
Description:  
The Energy Industry Revitalization Working Group must advise MCCC on issues and opportunities related to small business revitalization and the transition to renewable energy’s effects on small businesses. In particular, the working group must conduct a study of the impacts of transitioning to renewable energy.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1332
Name: Council on the Green Economy
Similarity: 0.5828
Score: 2
Type: Governance
Description: The members of the Council on the Green Economy serve to develop a blueprint for expanding the green economy and building a diverse workforce to support the Administration’s clean energy and climate goals. Members of the Council include representatives from State departments, as well as leaders from chambers of commerce, organized labor, industry, utilities, green business, environmental justice communities, academia, small business, workforce development, and environmental advocacy.
Just Transition Detail: The Council will lay out the pathways for transitioning fossil fuel and other displaced jobs to clean energy jobs, as well as laying the groundwork to ensure that the opportunities presented by the clean energy economy are open to a new generation of New Jersey workers, including people who are traditionally underrepresented in the energy sector. The Council is housed under the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. The Director of the Climate Action Office will be the Executive Director of the Council, overseeing it’s work and supervising its consultants. Working with the economic development team within the GO and relevant agencies and authorities across state government, the Director will ensure comprehensive policy and communicate the critical message that the transition to clean energy drives economic growth and job creation. Green Jobs Council objectives include but are not limited to: Coordination of relevant governmental programs; Incorporation of equitable workforce development strategies into all environmental and clean energy initiatives, including a framework to support high quality employment and collective bargaining; Significant targeted investment in workforce development, education, apprenticeship/internship, training and certification, and retraining programs; Formation of career services, green job pathways, and outreach to underrepresented and underserved groups, including women, and displaced fossil fuel workers; Dedicated supports for displaced workers including employment counseling, reskilling, transitional income, and relocation support.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses directive terms like “will lay out,” “coordination,” and “ensure,” but lacks unequivocally mandatory language (e.g., “shall” or “must”). While the Council is tasked with developing strategies and pathways, these are framed as objectives rather than enforceable requirements.
Source of Authority: Likely established via executive action under the Governor’s Office of Climate Action, not statutory law. Its authority stems from administrative structuring rather than codified legal mandates.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties, compliance deadlines, or oversight tools are specified. The Council’s role is strategic and advisory, focusing on planning and coordination without binding enforcement mechanisms for external actors (e.g., businesses, displaced workers).
Obligations: The Council itself is obligated to develop strategies and coordinate programs (e.g., workforce development, equitable investments), but these tasks are internal to the Council’s advisory function. External entities are not legally required to adopt the Council’s recommendations or participate in its initiatives.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation in the Council’s programs (e.g., workforce training, career services) is voluntary. The Council promotes incentives like “targeted investment” and “dedicated supports,” but these are framed as opportunities, not conditional requirements.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/246
Name: Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group
Similarity: 0.5574
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group is primarily composed of representatives of electric energy companies and will focus on energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency and battery backups.
THE WORKING GROUP SHALL: Advise the commission on issues and opportunities related to energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency improvement, and battery backup viability; and
Conduct a study of:
Methods for the state to encourage electricity storage technology research;
Methods of increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical facilities during widespread power outage;
Potential electric grid distribution transformation projects;
The potential to develop clean energy resources on previously developed project sites; and
The lifespan and viability of energy facilities in the state that do not emit Greenhouse Gas, including:1. Solar energy generating facilities
Nuclear energy generating facilities
Wind energy generating facilities
Geothermal energy generating facilities
Hydroelectric energy generating facilities
Biofuel energy generating facilities
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article, the Working Group shall report to the Commission and the General Assembly, on the findings of the study on or before December 31, 2023

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “THE WORKING GROUP SHALL advise,” “shall report”) for the working group’s actions, including conducting the study and submitting findings by a statutory deadline. While the study topics include terms like “encourage” and “supporting,” these describe the content of the study, not the working group’s obligations under the law.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, giving it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: The working group is legally required to complete and submit the report by December 31, 2023. Failure to meet this obligation would violate statutory requirements, triggering accountability (e.g., legislative oversight, potential legal action).
Obligations: The working group must conduct the study, advise the commission, and submit findings. The mandate focuses on process (completing tasks), not the outcome of recommendations (which may later require separate adoption).
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the working group’s formation, study, and reporting are compulsory.

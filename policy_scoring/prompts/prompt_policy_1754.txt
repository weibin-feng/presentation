You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/1754  
Policy Name: Utility Transportation Electrification Planning  
Type: Analysis and Tools  
Description:  
The governing body of a municipal electric utility or public utility district (PUD) may adopt an electrification of transportation plan that, at a minimum, establishes a finding that utility outreach and investment in the electrification of transportation infrastructure does not increase net costs to ratepayers in excess of 0.25 percent. Upon making a net cost determination, a municipal electric utility or a PUD may offer incentive programs in transportation electrification for its customers, including the promotion of electric vehicle adoption and advertising programs that promote the utility's services, incentives, or rebates.An investor-owned utility may submit to the Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) an electrification of transportation plan that deploys electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) or provides other electric transportation programs, services, or incentives to support electrification of transportation, provided that such EVSE programs or services do not increase costs to customers in excess of 0.25 percent above the benefits of electric transportation to all customers over a period consistent with the utility's planning horizon under its most recent integrated resource plan.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1082
Name: Multi-Unit Dwelling (MUD) Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Deployment Working Group
Similarity: 0.6846
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Multi-Unit Dwelling (MUD) Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Deployment Assessment The Hawaii State Energy Office must convene a working group to evaluate opportunities and barriers for installing EV charging stations in MUDs. The working group must:
Assess barriers to EV charging stations at MUDs;
Consider changes to state statutes and administrative code to support EV charging station deployment at MUDs;
Identify best practices for EV charging station installations at MUDs;
Create guidelines for EV charging stations in MUDs;
Develop solutions for EV charging cost recovery and electrical capacity management; and,
Develop recommendations for installing shared-use EV charging stations at MUDs.
The working group must prepare a report of its findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation and submit it to the Hawaii Legislature 20 days prior to the 2023 legislative session.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “must” (e.g., “The Hawaii State Energy Office must convene,” “the working group must prepare a report”), creating binding obligations for action.
Source of Authority: Likely statutory or regulatory, as it directs a state agency (Hawaii State Energy Office) to convene the working group and imposes formal reporting requirements to the legislature.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the requirement to submit a report to the legislature by a specific deadline implies accountability mechanisms (e.g., legislative oversight, potential follow-up mandates).
Obligations: The Hawaii State Energy Office is legally obligated to convene the working group, and the working group is required to complete defined tasks (e.g., assessing barriers, drafting guidelines) and submit legislative recommendations.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary language or incentives—compliance is compulsory. The working group’s activities and reporting are mandatory, not discretionary.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1259
Name: EV Charging Stations Requirements for New State Facility Construction
Similarity: 0.6609
Score: 3
Type: Standard
Description: (b) On and after January 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Administrative Services shall require each new construction of a state facility, the total project costs of which exceed one hundred thousand dollars, to be installed with level two electric vehicle charging stations in at least twenty per cent of the designated parking spaces for cars or light duty trucks at such facility. (c) On and after January 1, 2023, a municipality shall require each new construction of a commercial building or multiunit residential building with thirty or more designated parking spaces for cars or light duty trucks to include electric vehicle charging infrastructure that is capable of supporting level two electric vehicle charging stations or direct current fast charging stations in at least ten per cent of such parking spaces. A municipality may, through its legislative body, require any such commercial building or multiunit residential building to include such electric vehicle charging infrastructure in more than ten per cent of such parking spaces.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall require” (e.g., “the Commissioner shall require,” “a municipality shall require”) for the baseline requirements (20% for state facilities, 10% for commercial/residential buildings). The term “may” applies only to optional stricter standards beyond 10%.
Source of Authority: Likely statutory or regulatory (e.g., state building codes or administrative law), given the prescriptive language and delegation of authority to the Commissioner and municipalities.
Enforcement Mechanism: Compliance is tied to construction permits and project approvals (implied by the focus on new construction). Non-compliance could result in denial of permits or failure to meet building code standards, though penalties are not explicitly stated.
Obligations: State facilities and municipalities are legally obligated to enforce the minimum EV charging infrastructure percentages (20% for state facilities, 10% for commercial/residential). Municipalities have discretion to exceed the 10% threshold but must enforce the base requirement.
Optionality/Incentives: The 10% requirement for commercial/residential buildings is mandatory, with optionality only for stricter standards. No financial incentives are mentioned—compliance is compulsory for covered projects.

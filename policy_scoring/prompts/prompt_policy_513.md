You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/513  
Policy Name: Net Metering and Virtual Net Metering  
Type: Program  
Description:  
Net metering requires electric distribution companies to credit power produced by renewable energy systems installed behind a customer meter. Net Metering allows customers with eligible renewable energy systems to receive bill credits for all power generated up to 125 percent of the on-site consumption during a billing period.Virtual Net Metering allows eligible customers to connect their electric load regardless of whether the renewable system is located on the customers properties.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1082
Name: Multi-Unit Dwelling (MUD) Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Deployment Working Group
Similarity: 0.4389
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Multi-Unit Dwelling (MUD) Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Deployment Assessment The Hawaii State Energy Office must convene a working group to evaluate opportunities and barriers for installing EV charging stations in MUDs. The working group must:
Assess barriers to EV charging stations at MUDs;
Consider changes to state statutes and administrative code to support EV charging station deployment at MUDs;
Identify best practices for EV charging station installations at MUDs;
Create guidelines for EV charging stations in MUDs;
Develop solutions for EV charging cost recovery and electrical capacity management; and,
Develop recommendations for installing shared-use EV charging stations at MUDs.
The working group must prepare a report of its findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation and submit it to the Hawaii Legislature 20 days prior to the 2023 legislative session.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “must” (e.g., “The Hawaii State Energy Office must convene,” “the working group must prepare a report”), creating binding obligations for action.
Source of Authority: Likely statutory or regulatory, as it directs a state agency (Hawaii State Energy Office) to convene the working group and imposes formal reporting requirements to the legislature.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the requirement to submit a report to the legislature by a specific deadline implies accountability mechanisms (e.g., legislative oversight, potential follow-up mandates).
Obligations: The Hawaii State Energy Office is legally obligated to convene the working group, and the working group is required to complete defined tasks (e.g., assessing barriers, drafting guidelines) and submit legislative recommendations.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary language or incentives—compliance is compulsory. The working group’s activities and reporting are mandatory, not discretionary.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/247
Name: The Solar Photovoltaic Systems Recovery, Reuse, and Recycling Working Group
Similarity: 0.4346
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Photovoltaic Systems (PV) Working Group will focus on options for recycling or reusing solar panels.
The Working Group shall:
Review solar photovoltaic systems currently used in the state, including:Examining the expected economically productive life cycle of the systems; Reviewing the materials that are used, have been used, or may be used in PV systems sold in the state,including identifying materials that can be recycled or that exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law; andIdentifying the number of solar photovoltaic systems in use and estimating the potential impacts of the state's landfill capacity of disposing the systems in the state's landfills.
Review other programs on PV systems recycling, disposal, and decommissioning.
Identify ongoing and recent studies related to solar photovoltaic systems recycling, life-cycle analysis, and end-of-life programs.
Review industry-approved best practices for managing end-of-life solar photovoltaic systems and their components, including the extent to which the systems and components may be:if not substantially damaged, refurbished and reused for a similar purpose; recycled and the components recovered for reuse; for components that do not exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law, safely disposed of in a construction and demolition or municipal solid waste landfill; andfor components that exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste under state or federal law, safely disposed of in accordance with state and federal requirements;
Perform an economic analysis to determine the potential impact of solar photovoltaic systems recovery, reuse, and recycling n ratepayers, including a comparison to the economic impact on ratepayers of decommissioning, storing waste, and other costs associated with the end of life of other forms of energy generation;
Perform an impact assessment to examine the environmental impacts of various PV systems' end-of-life scenarios, including the scenarios specified under item 4 of this subsection, compared to the life-cycle environmental impacts of non-solar energy generation sources in the state, including the environmental impacts of decommissioning, disposal, and long-term waste storage;
Perform an impact assessment to examine the environmental and economic benefits of generating energy from PV systems, including a comparison to the environmental and economic benefits of non-solar energy generation sources in the state;
Recommend financing mechanisms analyzed under item 9 of this subsection that best support a circular economy approach.
Analyze whether financing mechanisms, including advance recovery fees, recycling and disposal fees, and product stewardship programs are necessary to ensure proper end-of-life management of solar photovoltaic systems; and
Examine and recommend infrastructure needed to develop a practical, effective, and cost-efficient method for collecting and transporting end-of-life solar photovoltaic modules for reuse, refurbishment, recycling, or disposal.
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article the Working Group shall report its findings and recommendation to the Commission and the General Assembly on or before December 31, 2023.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “The Working Group shall review,” “shall report”) for all tasks, including conducting studies, analyses, and submitting findings by the statutory deadline (December 31, 2023).
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, granting it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory reporting deadline and oversight by the Commission and General Assembly imply accountability. Non-compliance (e.g., failure to submit the report) would violate the law.
Obligations: The Working Group is legally required to:
Conduct all listed reviews, analyses, and assessments (e.g., economic analysis, environmental impact assessments).
Submit findings and recommendations to the legislature by the 2023 deadline.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the Working Group’s formation, tasks, and reporting are compulsory.

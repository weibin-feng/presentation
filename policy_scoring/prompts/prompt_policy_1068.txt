You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/1068  
Policy Name: Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund (EERF)  
Type: Program  
Description:  
Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced the first three energy-efficiency projects that will receive nearly $5 million in funding from the new Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund (EERF). Included in Governor Whitmer’s fiscal year 2022 budget recommendation and passed by the Michigan Legislature, the EERF provides an innovative opportunity to lower costs in state government and make government facilities more energy efficient and sustainable.State Warehouse Complex Solar Array: Construct a solar array system that will generate approximately 400,000 kilowatt hours of electricity and provide 100% of the electricity needed to power the State Facilities Administration Building. This is a joint project with the Lansing Board of Water and Light.General Services Building LED & Advance Lighting Controls Upgrade: Upgrade all lights in the General Services Building to LED with advanced lighting controls to optimize light utilization and provide savings on energy costs. The state will partner with Consumers Energy and Graybar to participate in Graybar’s Smart Lighting Turn Key Program, which streamlines the conversion to LED lighting. The estimated utility rebate for this project is about 50% of the total cost. DTMB will use 100% of the rebate funds to invest in additional LED and advanced lighting control projects. The savings will provide lighting for two additional buildings with funding from one project.St. Louis Correctional Facility Green Prison Initiative Energy Performance Project: Complete energy conservation measures designed to reduce energy use, water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and operating and maintenance costs at the St. Louis Correctional Complex. The projects include installing two 800-kilowatt solar photovoltaic arrays, replacing florescent lighting with energy-saving LED lights, and retrofitting and replacing 1,900 toilets, urinals, shower heads, and faucets.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/718
Name: CA Resilience Lead by Example Goal
Similarity: 0.6134
Score: 3
Type: Targets/Goal
Description: The Department of General Services shall leverage its management and ownership of the state's 19 million square feet in managed buildings, 51,000 vehicles and other physical assets and goods to minimize state government's carbon footprint. To accomplish this, the Department of General Services shall: c. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate risk from the state's owned and future-leased buildings, d. Manage energy demand to maximize benefits to the grid, and
Resilience Detail: mitigate climate risk from the state's owned and future-leased buildings

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses unequivocally mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “The Department of General Services shall leverage,” “shall reduce”), creating binding legal obligations for the agency.
Source of Authority: Likely codified in state law or regulation (implied by the directive to a state department and prescriptive language), granting it statutory enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties are not detailed, compliance is inherent to the state’s governance framework. Failure to meet obligations could trigger administrative accountability (e.g., reporting to the legislature, budget sanctions).
Obligations: The Department of General Services is legally required to:
Minimize the state government’s carbon footprint.
Reduce GHG emissions and climate risks in state-owned/leased buildings.
Manage energy demand to benefit the grid.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary language or incentives—compliance is compulsory.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/200
Name: Illinois Finance Authority Climate Bank
Similarity: 0.5863
Score: 2
Type: Program
Description: The bill designates the Illinois Finance Authority, established in the Illinois Finance Authority Act, as a "Climate Bank" to leverage public-private partnerships to fund clean energy projects across the state. In its role as the Climate Bank of the State, the Authority shall have the power to: (i) administer programs and funds appropriated by the General Assembly for clean energy projects in eligible communities and environmental justice communities or owned by eligible persons, (ii) support investment in the clean energy and clean water, drinking water, and wastewater treatment, (iii) support and otherwise promote investment in clean energy projects to foster the growth, development, and commercialization of clean energy projects and related enterprises, and (iv) stimulate demand for clean energy and the development of clean energy projects

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses a mix of mandatory and non-binding terms. While the Illinois Finance Authority “shall have the power” to administer programs and support clean energy projects, the language focuses on enabling functions (e.g., “support,” “promote”) rather than imposing obligations on external actors.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (bill under the Illinois Finance Authority Act), granting the Climate Bank legal authority to operate. However, the program itself functions as a funding and partnership mechanism, not a regulatory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties or compliance requirements are specified. The Climate Bank’s role is to facilitate funding and partnerships, with participation by private entities or communities being voluntary.
Obligations: The Authority is legally obligated to administer programs and funds, but external actors (e.g., businesses, communities) are not required to participate. Compliance is optional for project applicants or partners.
Optionality/Incentives: Participation in Climate Bank programs is voluntary and incentivized through funding opportunities.

You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/1838  
Policy Name: California's Nature-Based Solutions Climate Targets  
Type: Targets/Goal  
Description:  
As called for in Assembly Bill 1757 (2022), the California Natural Resources Agency, the California Air Resources Board, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and more than 40 State agency partners collaborated to develop 81 nature-based solutions (NBS) climate targets for 2030, 2038, and 2045 that contribute to California’s goals of achieving carbon neutrality no later than 2045 and protecting Californians from the climate crisis.What the targets call for by 2045:33.5 million acres managed to reduce wildfire risk, mostly through beneficial fire11.9 million acres of forest managed for biodiversity protection, carbon storage, and water supply protection7.6 million acres conserved with protections3.4 million acres of croplands managed to boost healthy soils, drought resilience, and below-ground biodiversity4.2 million trees planted to protect California communities from the climate crisis, remove carbon and increase access to nature where it’s needed most2.7 million acres of shrublands and chaparral managed for carbon storage, resilience, and habitat connectivity1.6 million acres of grasslands managed to restore native grasslands and protect biodiversity1.5 million acres of sparsely vegetated lands (deserts, beaches, etc.) to protect fragile ecosystems

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/61
Name: Adaptation Clearinghouse
Similarity: 0.6131
Score: 1
Type: Analysis and Tools
Description: The Adaptation Clearinghouse allows you to navigate a searchable database of adaptation and resilience resources that have been organized by climate impact, topic, and region. Importantly, the Adaptation Clearinghouse also provides a platform for Californians to share and access case studies and stories about how and why their communities, businesses, and organizations are responding to climate change impacts

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses non-binding terms such as "allows," "provides," and "share and access," emphasizing voluntary participation. No mandatory directives (e.g., "shall," "must") are present.
Source of Authority: Likely established as an administrative tool under California’s climate initiatives, not codified in statutory law or regulation. It functions as an informational resource platform.
Enforcement Mechanism: No penalties, compliance requirements, or oversight tools. The Clearinghouse operates purely as a database and knowledge-sharing hub.
Obligations: No legal obligations are imposed on users (e.g., communities, businesses) to contribute to or utilize the Clearinghouse. Participation is entirely optional.
Optionality/Incentives: No financial incentives or penalties. Engagement is driven by voluntary interest in accessing or sharing resources.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/631
Name: 2040 Zero-Carbon Target
Similarity: 0.6084
Score: 3
Type: Targets/Goal
Description: Public Act 22-5 (Senate Bill 10), An Act Concerning Climate Change Mitigation: This bill, which was sponsored by Governor Lamont, codifies into law the 2040 zero-carbon electric grid goal that Governor Lamont established through an executive order that he issued in 2019 (Executive Order No. 3).
The state shall reduce the level of emissions of greenhouse gas: (1) Not later than January 1, 2020, to a level at least ten per cent below the level emitted in 1990; (2) Not later than January 1, 2030, to a level at least forty-five percent below the level emitted in 2001; [and] (3) Not later than January 1, 2040, to a level of zero per cent from electricity supplied to electric customers in the state; (4) Not later than January 1, 2050, to a level at least eighty percent below the level emitted in 2001; [.] and (5) All of the levels referenced in this subsection shall be determined by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the state shall reduce”) and specifies binding deadlines (e.g., 2040 for zero-carbon electricity) with quantified emissions targets.
Source of Authority: Codified into law via Public Act 22-5 (statute), granting it legal enforceability. This elevates it from the original executive order to a statutory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties are not detailed, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection is legally tasked with determining compliance levels, implying regulatory oversight and potential enforcement tools (e.g., future regulations or reporting requirements).
Obligations: The state is legally obligated to meet the emissions reduction targets, though the law does not specify obligations for individual entities (e.g., utilities, industries). Compliance likely depends on subsequent regulations or sector-specific policies.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs, exemptions, or incentives. The targets are compulsory for the state as a whole, with no flexibility in deadlines or thresholds.

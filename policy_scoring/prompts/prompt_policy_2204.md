You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/2204  
Policy Name: Prohousing Designation Program  
Type: Program  
Description:  
Increasing the availability of housing statewide is critical to bettering the quality of life of all Californians and to ending homelessness. The 2019-2020 Budget Act provided a spectrum of support, incentives, and accountability measures to meet California’s housing goals, and provided for the establishment of the Prohousing Designation Program.The Prohousing Designation Program (PDP) seeks to acknowledge and support jurisdictions that go above-and-beyond state housing law to help accelerate housing production. PDP includes criteria around Favorable Zoning and Land Use that can facilitate more location-efficient development.A jurisdiction with a Prohousing Designation may receive priority processing or funding points when applying for several funding programs, including Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC), Infill Infrastructure Grant (IIG), Transformative Climate Communities (TCC), Solutions for Congested Corridors (SCCP), Local Partnership Program (LPP), Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program (TIRCP), and Sustainable Transportation Planning Grant Program (STPG).Receiving a Prohousing Designation also allows jurisdictions to apply to the Prohousing Incentive Program. PIP is designed to reward local governments with additional funding to accelerate affordable housing production and preservation.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/1841
Name: Density and Missing Middle Housing Requirements
Similarity: 0.5566
Score: 3
Type: Standard
Description: Requires local jurisdictions to allow an increase in density of qualified projects located within 3/4 mile of passenger rail stations. Also allows middle housing units in single-family residential zones, and allows for greater density levels for qualified projects built in multifamily, nonresidential, and mixed-use zones.EQUITY DETAILQualified projects are those that include a minimum percentage of affordable housing units.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses the term **"requires"**, indicating mandatory action by local jurisdictions.
Source of Authority: It is labeled as a **"Standard"**, which typically implies regulatory backing rather than a guideline or program.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the term “requires” strongly implies enforceability under planning or zoning law.
Obligations: Local jurisdictions are **obligated to allow increased density** under defined conditions.
Optionality/Incentives: There is no indication that compliance is voluntary or incentivized—rather, it appears to be **a planning requirement** with clear qualifying criteria (affordable housing minimums).


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/1580
Name: Green and Healthy Task Force
Similarity: 0.5501
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: BEGINNING JULY 1, 2023, MEET QUARTERLY FOR A PERIOD OF 3 YEARS; ADVANCE THE ALIGNMENT, BRANDING, AND COORDINATION OF RESOURCES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER GREEN AND HEALTHY HOUSING FOR LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE; EXAMINE THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF LOW–INCOME COMMUNITIES; DEVELOP POLICY AND STATUTORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING HEALTHY, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND AFFORDABLE, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING; AND ENGAGE WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT CAN HELP ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE TASK FORCE, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHY AND, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING. ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2024, AND EACH JULY 1 THROUGH 2027, THE TASK FORCE SHALL REPORT ITS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, THE SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMMISSION, THE GOVERNOR, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 2–1257 OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT ARTICLE, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the Task Force shall report its findings”) and specifies deadlines (e.g., “on or before July 1, 2024”). These terms impose clear obligations.
Source of Authority: The task force is tied to statutory law (§ 2–1257 of the State Government Article), indicating it was established through legislative authority, which carries legal weight.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory foundation implies accountability mechanisms (e.g., governmental oversight) for meeting reporting deadlines and operational requirements (e.g., quarterly meetings).
Obligations: The task force is legally obligated to meet quarterly, develop recommendations, and submit annual reports to state officials and the legislature. Participation in the task force itself is likely mandatory for appointed members.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs or incentives are mentioned. The policy creates binding procedural requirements for the task force, even though its recommendations may later require separate adoption to become enforceable.

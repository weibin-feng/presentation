You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")

- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

> Note: Use judgment based on overall context, not just keywords.

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/1005  
Policy Name: Electric Grid Modernization Program  
Type: Program  
Description:  
In the fall of 2020, EMNRD convened the Grid Modernization Advisory Group (GMAG) to produce a series of action-oriented whitepapers to inform New Mexico’s Grid Modernization Roadmap. The Roadmap serves as a guide to electric service providers, regulators, policymakers, and consumers as New Mexico transitions to 100-percent zero-carbon electricity resources by mid-century in accordance with the Energy Transition Act of 2019.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Policy ID: policy/246
Name: Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group
Similarity: 0.6078
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group is primarily composed of representatives of electric energy companies and will focus on energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency and battery backups.
THE WORKING GROUP SHALL: Advise the commission on issues and opportunities related to energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency improvement, and battery backup viability; and
Conduct a study of:
Methods for the state to encourage electricity storage technology research;
Methods of increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical facilities during widespread power outage;
Potential electric grid distribution transformation projects;
The potential to develop clean energy resources on previously developed project sites; and
The lifespan and viability of energy facilities in the state that do not emit Greenhouse Gas, including:1. Solar energy generating facilities
Nuclear energy generating facilities
Wind energy generating facilities
Geothermal energy generating facilities
Hydroelectric energy generating facilities
Biofuel energy generating facilities
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article, the Working Group shall report to the Commission and the General Assembly, on the findings of the study on or before December 31, 2023

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “THE WORKING GROUP SHALL advise,” “shall report”) for the working group’s actions, including conducting the study and submitting findings by a statutory deadline. While the study topics include terms like “encourage” and “supporting,” these describe the content of the study, not the working group’s obligations under the law.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, giving it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: The working group is legally required to complete and submit the report by December 31, 2023. Failure to meet this obligation would violate statutory requirements, triggering accountability (e.g., legislative oversight, potential legal action).
Obligations: The working group must conduct the study, advise the commission, and submit findings. The mandate focuses on process (completing tasks), not the outcome of recommendations (which may later require separate adoption).
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the working group’s formation, study, and reporting are compulsory.


Case 2:
Policy ID: policy/631
Name: 2040 Zero-Carbon Target
Similarity: 0.5817
Score: 3
Type: Targets/Goal
Description: Public Act 22-5 (Senate Bill 10), An Act Concerning Climate Change Mitigation: This bill, which was sponsored by Governor Lamont, codifies into law the 2040 zero-carbon electric grid goal that Governor Lamont established through an executive order that he issued in 2019 (Executive Order No. 3).
The state shall reduce the level of emissions of greenhouse gas: (1) Not later than January 1, 2020, to a level at least ten per cent below the level emitted in 1990; (2) Not later than January 1, 2030, to a level at least forty-five percent below the level emitted in 2001; [and] (3) Not later than January 1, 2040, to a level of zero per cent from electricity supplied to electric customers in the state; (4) Not later than January 1, 2050, to a level at least eighty percent below the level emitted in 2001; [.] and (5) All of the levels referenced in this subsection shall be determined by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the state shall reduce”) and specifies binding deadlines (e.g., 2040 for zero-carbon electricity) with quantified emissions targets.
Source of Authority: Codified into law via Public Act 22-5 (statute), granting it legal enforceability. This elevates it from the original executive order to a statutory mandate.
Enforcement Mechanism: While explicit penalties are not detailed, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection is legally tasked with determining compliance levels, implying regulatory oversight and potential enforcement tools (e.g., future regulations or reporting requirements).
Obligations: The state is legally obligated to meet the emissions reduction targets, though the law does not specify obligations for individual entities (e.g., utilities, industries). Compliance likely depends on subsequent regulations or sector-specific policies.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs, exemptions, or incentives. The targets are compulsory for the state as a whole, with no flexibility in deadlines or thresholds.

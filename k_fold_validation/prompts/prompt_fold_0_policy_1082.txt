You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")
  
- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/1082  
Policy Name: Multi-Unit Dwelling (MUD) Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Deployment Working Group  
Type: Governance  
Description:  
Multi-Unit Dwelling (MUD) Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Deployment Assessment The Hawaii State Energy Office must convene a working group to evaluate opportunities and barriers for installing EV charging stations in MUDs. The working group must:
Assess barriers to EV charging stations at MUDs;
Consider changes to state statutes and administrative code to support EV charging station deployment at MUDs;
Identify best practices for EV charging station installations at MUDs;
Create guidelines for EV charging stations in MUDs;
Develop solutions for EV charging cost recovery and electrical capacity management; and,
Develop recommendations for installing shared-use EV charging stations at MUDs.
The working group must prepare a report of its findings, recommendations, and proposed legislation and submit it to the Hawaii Legislature 20 days prior to the 2023 legislative session.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Similarity: 0.67
Policy ID: policy/1259
Name: EV Charging Stations Requirements for New State Facility Construction
Score: 3
Type: Standard
Description: (b) On and after January 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Administrative Services shall require each new construction of a state facility, the total project costs of which exceed one hundred thousand dollars, to be installed with level two electric vehicle charging stations in at least twenty per cent of the designated parking spaces for cars or light duty trucks at such facility. (c) On and after January 1, 2023, a municipality shall require each new construction of a commercial building or multiunit residential building with thirty or more designated parking spaces for cars or light duty trucks to include electric vehicle charging infrastructure that is capable of supporting level two electric vehicle charging stations or direct current fast charging stations in at least ten per cent of such parking spaces. A municipality may, through its legislative body, require any such commercial building or multiunit residential building to include such electric vehicle charging infrastructure in more than ten per cent of such parking spaces.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall require” (e.g., “the Commissioner shall require,” “a municipality shall require”) for the baseline requirements (20% for state facilities, 10% for commercial/residential buildings). The term “may” applies only to optional stricter standards beyond 10%.
Source of Authority: Likely statutory or regulatory (e.g., state building codes or administrative law), given the prescriptive language and delegation of authority to the Commissioner and municipalities.
Enforcement Mechanism: Compliance is tied to construction permits and project approvals (implied by the focus on new construction). Non-compliance could result in denial of permits or failure to meet building code standards, though penalties are not explicitly stated.
Obligations: State facilities and municipalities are legally obligated to enforce the minimum EV charging infrastructure percentages (20% for state facilities, 10% for commercial/residential). Municipalities have discretion to exceed the 10% threshold but must enforce the base requirement.
Optionality/Incentives: The 10% requirement for commercial/residential buildings is mandatory, with optionality only for stricter standards. No financial incentives are mentioned—compliance is compulsory for covered projects.


Case 2:
Similarity: 0.61
Policy ID: policy/246
Name: Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group is primarily composed of representatives of electric energy companies and will focus on energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency and battery backups.
THE WORKING GROUP SHALL: Advise the commission on issues and opportunities related to energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency improvement, and battery backup viability; and
Conduct a study of:
Methods for the state to encourage electricity storage technology research;
Methods of increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical facilities during widespread power outage;
Potential electric grid distribution transformation projects;
The potential to develop clean energy resources on previously developed project sites; and
The lifespan and viability of energy facilities in the state that do not emit Greenhouse Gas, including:1. Solar energy generating facilities
Nuclear energy generating facilities
Wind energy generating facilities
Geothermal energy generating facilities
Hydroelectric energy generating facilities
Biofuel energy generating facilities
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article, the Working Group shall report to the Commission and the General Assembly, on the findings of the study on or before December 31, 2023

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “THE WORKING GROUP SHALL advise,” “shall report”) for the working group’s actions, including conducting the study and submitting findings by a statutory deadline. While the study topics include terms like “encourage” and “supporting,” these describe the content of the study, not the working group’s obligations under the law.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, giving it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: The working group is legally required to complete and submit the report by December 31, 2023. Failure to meet this obligation would violate statutory requirements, triggering accountability (e.g., legislative oversight, potential legal action).
Obligations: The working group must conduct the study, advise the commission, and submit findings. The mandate focuses on process (completing tasks), not the outcome of recommendations (which may later require separate adoption).
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the working group’s formation, study, and reporting are compulsory.

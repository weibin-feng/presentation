You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")
  
- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

---

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Similarity: 0.63
Policy ID: policy/246
Name: Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: Created by the Climate Solutions Now Act in 2022, The Energy Resilience and Efficiency Working Group is primarily composed of representatives of electric energy companies and will focus on energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency and battery backups.
THE WORKING GROUP SHALL: Advise the commission on issues and opportunities related to energy infrastructure improvements, transmission efficiency improvement, and battery backup viability; and
Conduct a study of:
Methods for the state to encourage electricity storage technology research;
Methods of increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical facilities during widespread power outage;
Potential electric grid distribution transformation projects;
The potential to develop clean energy resources on previously developed project sites; and
The lifespan and viability of energy facilities in the state that do not emit Greenhouse Gas, including:1. Solar energy generating facilities
Nuclear energy generating facilities
Wind energy generating facilities
Geothermal energy generating facilities
Hydroelectric energy generating facilities
Biofuel energy generating facilities
In accordance with § 2–1257 of the state government article, the Working Group shall report to the Commission and the General Assembly, on the findings of the study on or before December 31, 2023

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “THE WORKING GROUP SHALL advise,” “shall report”) for the working group’s actions, including conducting the study and submitting findings by a statutory deadline. While the study topics include terms like “encourage” and “supporting,” these describe the content of the study, not the working group’s obligations under the law.
Source of Authority: Established by statute (Climate Solutions Now Act 2022) and tied to § 2–1257 of the state government article, giving it legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: The working group is legally required to complete and submit the report by December 31, 2023. Failure to meet this obligation would violate statutory requirements, triggering accountability (e.g., legislative oversight, potential legal action).
Obligations: The working group must conduct the study, advise the commission, and submit findings. The mandate focuses on process (completing tasks), not the outcome of recommendations (which may later require separate adoption).
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary participation—the working group’s formation, study, and reporting are compulsory.


Case 2:
Similarity: 0.60
Policy ID: policy/1016
Name: Energy Code Board
Score: 3
Type: Standard
Description: The Colorado General Assembly passed the Building Energy Codes law (HB22-1362 Building Greenhouse Gas Emissions) in May of 2022 to improve energy use and efficiency in buildings. An updated energy code is an important tool to increase building efficiency and meet the state’s economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 50% by 2030, from a 2005 baseline.
The legislation directs the Energy Code Board to perform the following work: Model Electric Ready and Solar Ready Code - the Energy Code Board will develop and adopt a model electric ready code and solar ready code with the intent to prepare new homes and buildings for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and high efficiency electric appliances. These codes must be adopted by the Board on or before June 1, 2023. Cities and counties with building codes must adopt at least the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) when they update other building codes between July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2026. This adoption must include the electric and solar ready provisions in the model electric ready and solar ready code. Model Low Energy and Carbon Code - the Energy Code Board will develop and adopt a model low energy and carbon code with the intent of minimizing overall carbon dioxide emissions associated with new and renovated homes and commercial buildings, based on either the 2021 IECC or the 2024 IECC, plus any appendices and the model electric ready and solar ready code. This code must be adopted by the Board on or before June 1, 2025. Cities and counties with building codes must adopt the model low energy and carbon code when they update other building codes after July 1, 2026.
In addition to the work of the Energy Code Board, the Colorado Energy Office is directed by this legislation to perform the following work: Model Green Code - CEO will promote a model green code that local governments may voluntarily adopt, in addition to the required energy code. The model green code addresses building attributes such as materials, water use, and indoor air quality. Code Training Assistance and Building Upgrades - the Legislature appropriated $4 million for CEO to provide code training and assistance, along with $21 million to support decarbonization of public buildings and communities with a focus on incentives for lower income households and historically disadvantaged communities.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “must adopt” (e.g., “cities and counties must adopt at least the 2021 IECC”), “directs,” and “will develop and adopt,” with strict deadlines (e.g., “on or before June 1, 2023”). The voluntary “may adopt” applies only to the non-binding model green code.
Source of Authority: Codified in state law (HB22-1362), giving it statutory authority. The Energy Code Board and Colorado Energy Office are legally mandated to act.
Enforcement Mechanism: Compliance is enforced through building code updates: cities/counties updating codes must adopt the state’s model energy codes. While penalties are not explicitly stated, non-compliance would likely affect permitting or legal approval for construction projects.
Obligations: The Energy Code Board must develop and adopt model codes by statutory deadlines. Cities/counties with building codes must adopt the 2021 IECC (with electric/solar-ready provisions) by 2026 and the low-energy/carbon code after 2026. The Colorado Energy Office must promote the voluntary green code and administer funding.
Optionality/Incentives: The model green code is voluntary (“may adopt”). $25 million in funding incentivizes training and building upgrades, but code adoption itself is compulsory for local governments.

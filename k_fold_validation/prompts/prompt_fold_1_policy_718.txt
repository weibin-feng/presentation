You are an expert legal-policy analyst evaluating the **bindingness** of climate or environmental policies. Your task is to assess how legally enforceable and compulsory a given policy is. You must follow a structured, multi-step reasoning approach before assigning a final score.

---

Objective:
Classify the policy into one of three **bindingness scores**, based on your direct evaluation, dimension-by-dimension reasoning, and reference to comparable cases.


---

### Scoring Categories:

- **Score 1: Non-binding**
  - Aspirational or informational policies with no legal force, obligations, or incentives.
  - Often appear as reports, plans, advisory boards, or descriptive indexes.
  - **Common keywords**: may, encourage, develop, planning goals

- **Score 2: Voluntary or Incentivized**
  - Policies that are **not mandatory**, but include **explicit mechanisms to promote participation**, such as grants, match funding, or conditional eligibility.
  - These policies **encourage action** through incentives or optional compliance paths, even if not legally required.
  - Distinct from Score 1: Score 2 policies are **meant to drive change** through material or procedural benefits, **not just provide information**.
  - **Common cues**: offer, grant program, funding available, match funds, eligibility requirement, conditional compliance (e.g., "where practicable")
  
- **Score 3: Mandatory**
  - Legally binding measures from statute, regulation, or executive order with enforceable obligations.
  - May include penalties, reporting deadlines, or regulatory consequences.
  - **Common keywords**: must, shall, is required to, mandate, penalty, enforce

### Evaluation Dimensions (Used for Explanation):

For each of the five dimensions, answer both components:

1. **Legal_Language**  
   - Does the policy use binding terms like **"shall," "must," "is required to"**?  
   - Or does it use non-binding terms like **"may," "encourage," "help," "support," "goal"**?

2. **Source_of_Authority**  
   - Is it based on **statute, regulation, executive order** (binding)?  
   - Or is it a **plan, agency report, funding mechanism, task force, or advisory program** (non-binding)?

3. **Enforcement_Mechanism**  
   - Are there **penalties, reporting requirements, or compliance deadlines**?  
   - Or is it **aspirational** with **no consequence** for failure to comply?

4. **Obligations**  
   - Who is obligated to act?  
   - Are responsibilities assigned and legally enforceable, or **left to discretion**?

5. **Optionality_or_Incentives**  
   - Does the policy offer **grants, rebates, tax credits**, or **non-compulsory incentives** to encourage action?


### Step-by-step Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Current Policy**
   - Examine each of the five dimensions.
   - Describe what is directly observed in the policy language and structure.

2. **Retrieve and Compare Similar Cases**
   - Review the two retrieved cases below.
   - Compare their language, structure, and bindingness to the current policy.

3. **Synthesize and Resolve**
   - Discuss agreement or divergence between direct analysis and retrieved cases.
   - Highlight any ambiguous elements or borderline scores.

4. **Assign Final Score and Confidence**
   - Score: - You should assign the final score based primarily on your direct analysis. Retrieved cases serve as contextual benchmarks.
   - Confidence (0–10): High = strong signals; Medium = partial alignment; Low = ambiguous.

### Current Policy for Evaluation:

Policy ID: policy/718  
Policy Name: CA Resilience Lead by Example Goal  
Type: Targets/Goal  
Description:  
The Department of General Services shall leverage its management and ownership of the state's 19 million square feet in managed buildings, 51,000 vehicles and other physical assets and goods to minimize state government's carbon footprint. To accomplish this, the Department of General Services shall: c. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate risk from the state's owned and future-leased buildings, d. Manage energy demand to maximize benefits to the grid, and
Resilience Detail: mitigate climate risk from the state's owned and future-leased buildings

### Retrieved Reference Cases:

Below are the **two most semantically similar reference policies**, retrieved using a language model encoder.  
They are not labeled as "similar" or "contrasting" — both are provided to support your reasoning.

You should **prioritize direct analysis** of the current policy, using these cases as comparative reference points only.




Case 1:
Similarity: 0.64
Policy ID: policy/1482
Name: 2015, 2025, 2030, 2050 Statewide GHG Targets
Score: 2
Type: Targets/Goal
Description: Sec. 61. Minnesota Statutes 2022, section 216H.02, subdivision 1, is amended to read: Subdivision 1.Greenhouse gas emissions-reduction goal.(a) It is the goal of the state to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors producing those greenhouse gas emissions by at least the following amounts, compared with the level of emissions in 2005:(1) 15 percent by 2015;(2) 30 percent by 2025;(3) 50 percent by 2030; and(4) to net zero by 2050.To the maximum extent practicable, actions taken to achieve these goals must avoid causing disproportionate adverse impacts to residents of communities that are or have been incommensurately exposed to pollution affecting human health and environmental quality.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy frames GHG reduction targets as a non-binding "goal of the state" rather than using mandatory terms like "shall" or "must." While the clause "actions taken to achieve these goals must avoid disproportionate adverse impacts" imposes a binding equity requirement, this applies only to implementation methods, not the GHG targets themselves.
Source of Authority: Codified in state law (Minnesota Statutes §216H.02), but the statute lacks actionable mandates or delegated authority for enforcement. The "goal" language weakens legal enforceability.
Enforcement Mechanism: No compliance mechanisms (e.g., penalties, sector-specific regulations) or accountability tools (e.g., reporting deadlines) are specified. The law does not empower agencies to enforce the targets.
Obligations: The state is not legally required to take specific actions (e.g., passing regulations, funding programs) to meet the targets. No responsibilities are assigned to agencies, industries, or individuals.
Optionality/Incentives: No financial incentives (e.g., grants, tax credits) or penalties for non-compliance. Achievement of targets relies on future discretionary policies.


Case 2:
Similarity: 0.61
Policy ID: policy/1580
Name: Green and Healthy Task Force
Score: 3
Type: Governance
Description: BEGINNING JULY 1, 2023, MEET QUARTERLY FOR A PERIOD OF 3 YEARS; ADVANCE THE ALIGNMENT, BRANDING, AND COORDINATION OF RESOURCES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER GREEN AND HEALTHY HOUSING FOR LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE; EXAMINE THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF LOW–INCOME COMMUNITIES; DEVELOP POLICY AND STATUTORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO LOW–INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING HEALTHY, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND AFFORDABLE, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING; AND ENGAGE WITH INTERESTED PARTIES AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT CAN HELP ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE TASK FORCE, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHY AND, ENERGY–EFFICIENT, AND LOW–EMISSIONS HOUSING. ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2024, AND EACH JULY 1 THROUGH 2027, THE TASK FORCE SHALL REPORT ITS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, THE SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMMISSION, THE GOVERNOR, AND, IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 2–1257 OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT ARTICLE, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

Explanation: Legal Language: The policy uses mandatory terms such as “shall” (e.g., “the Task Force shall report its findings”) and specifies deadlines (e.g., “on or before July 1, 2024”). These terms impose clear obligations.
Source of Authority: The task force is tied to statutory law (§ 2–1257 of the State Government Article), indicating it was established through legislative authority, which carries legal weight.
Enforcement Mechanism: While penalties are not explicitly stated, the statutory foundation implies accountability mechanisms (e.g., governmental oversight) for meeting reporting deadlines and operational requirements (e.g., quarterly meetings).
Obligations: The task force is legally obligated to meet quarterly, develop recommendations, and submit annual reports to state officials and the legislature. Participation in the task force itself is likely mandatory for appointed members.
Optionality/Incentives: No voluntary opt-outs or incentives are mentioned. The policy creates binding procedural requirements for the task force, even though its recommendations may later require separate adoption to become enforceable.

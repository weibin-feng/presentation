    "Legal_Language": "The policy uses binding terms such as 'shall' (e.g., 'The Department of General Services shall leverage its management...', 'the Department of General Services shall: c. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions...'). These terms impose clear obligations.",
    "Source_of_Authority": "The policy appears to stem from a statutory or regulatory source, given the mandatory language and the specific obligations assigned to the Department of General Services.",
    "Enforcement_Mechanism": "While the policy does not explicitly mention penalties, the use of 'shall' implies enforceable obligations. The Department of General Services is legally required to take specific actions, suggesting accountability mechanisms may exist.",
    "Obligations": "The Department of General Services is explicitly obligated to act, with responsibilities assigned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and manage energy demand. These responsibilities are legally enforceable.",
